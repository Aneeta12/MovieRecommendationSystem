# Movie Recommendation System

## Description
This project implements a hybrid recommendation system designed for a movie streaming service. The system combines collaborative filtering techniques with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and incorporates temporal decay factors. It aims to enhance the user experience by providing personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and historical data.

## Features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Utilizes collaborative filtering and SVD to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Temporal Decay**: Accounts for changes in user preferences over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Jupyter notebook implementation for easy interaction and visualization of results.

## Usage
After installation, run the MovieRecommendationSystem.ipynb Jupyter notebook to interact with the recommendation system. You can modify the parameters in the notebook to explore different configurations and see how they affect the recommendations.
